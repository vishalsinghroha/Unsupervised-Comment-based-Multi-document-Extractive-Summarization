b'\nIn the immediate hours following Thursday\'s disaster, Gavin said "the airline needs to share every piece of information and every piece of data they have, including the decision making process that led to that plane flying over a recent conflict region."\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed over eastern Ukraine on Thursday with 298 people aboard by what American intelligence authorities believe was a surface-to-air missile. Just four months earlier, a Malaysia Airlines jetliner carrying 239 people disappeared about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. The jet has still not been found, a source of profound unease for travelers and the aviation industry.\n"Last time I saw them, the plane was almost empty and so I suspect, probably losing a lot of money," said tourist Ricky Leong as he checked in for a Malaysia Airlines flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. "They\'re not going to maintain their fleet and there\'s going to be issues in the future."\nAt an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council called by Britain on Friday, the UK\'s ambassador Sir Mark Lyall Grant said "searching questions" had to be asked about Russia\'s links with armed separatists and called for Moscow to issue an "unequivocal condemnation" of their actions.\nKorean Air Line also said it had rerouted cargo and passenger flights in early March amid the worsening situation over the Crimean peninsula. A company official, who requested anonymity in line with department rules, said Korean Air Line had had 42 flights  26 cargo and 16 passenger flights  which flew over Ukraine before.\nThe carrier, and the Malaysian government, came under heavy criticism for its handling of MH370\'s disappearance  particularly in China, which lost more than 150 nationals in that disaster. While any airline and any nation would have struggled with the extraordinary twists and turns in a mystery that remains unresolved, relatives complained of confused and contradictory information and insensitivity on the part of the government and company.\n"This comes very close [in time]; it was the same airline; the same aeroplane type. It happened outside the more common way of crashing for big airlines; most accidents happen close to landing or just after takeoff. They both have an element of mystery and perhaps unlawful and external interference," noted Sidney Dekker, an expert on aviation safety at Griffith University.\nBut that is a big if. Five years after Trans World Airlines flight 800 crashed into the ocean near New York in 1996 with the loss of 230 lives, the carrier filed for bankruptcy and was acquired by American Airlines. For an already troubled company, the disaster was the straw that broke the camel\'s back, said Dekker.\nU.S. intelligence assessments suggest that Russia provided separatists in eastern Ukraine with sophisticated antiaircraft systems in recent weeks, including the missile that brought down a Malaysia Airlines plane, killing all 298 aboard, two senior U.S. officials told Fox News late Saturday. \nThe officials told Fox News that President Barack Obama received "multiple" intelligence assessments regarding the crash of Flight MH17 at Camp David, where he is spending the weekend. The president\'s national security aides also held several meetings to discuss the situation in Ukraine, where separatists are reportedly limiting international investigators\' access to the crash site. \nSecretary of State John Kerry will appear on all five Sunday morning talk shows, including "Fox News Sunday," and is expected to aggressively pin the blame on Russia for the downed airliner. Kerry is also expected to call for investigators to have "unfettered access" to the crash site, restating a message he delivered to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov when the two spoke Saturday. \nThe missile is the latest piece of evidence tying the jet tragedy to Moscow and its separatist clients. Earlier Saturday, U.S. officials told Fox News that senior Western intelligence officials believe they have found evidence that the Russian commander Igor "Strelkov" Girkin oversaw the deadly missile strike.\nU.S. officials think Girkin oversaw the missile strike in part because of social media posts he made shortly after the Malaysian plane went down. And they have an intercepted phone conversation purportedly between a Girkin lieutenant and a handler in the Russian military intelligence service in which the fighter seems to say his team shot down the plane.
